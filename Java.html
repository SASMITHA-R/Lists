    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile applications, and enterprise software systems. It is known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability, which means code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java syntax and structure is similar to C-based languages like C++ and C#. Its robustness, platform-independent compatibility, and strong memory management have made it a go-to language for developers worldwide.</p>
