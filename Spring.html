    <p>The <strong>Spring </strong>Framework is a powerful, lightweight, and widely used Java framework for building enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for Java-based applications, making development faster, scalable, and maintainable.

Before Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), JavaBeans were used for developing Web applications, but they lacked essential services like transaction management and security. EJB was introduced to address this by offering services for enterprise application development. However, it was complex, requiring developers to create Home and Remote interfaces and implement lifecycle methods.

Spring Framework emerged as a solution to these complications. It simplifies enterprise application development by using techniques like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Objects (POJO), and Dependency Injection (DI). Spring is an open-source, lightweight framework that enables Java EE developers to build scalable and reliable applications, offering simpler alternatives to traditional Java APIs like JDBC, JSP, and Servlets.</p>
