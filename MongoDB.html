    <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented NoSQL database developed by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) and released in 2009. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy scalability. Key features include sharding for horizontal scaling, replication for high availability, and support for multi-document ACID transactions from version 4.0 onwards. MongoDB Atlas, its fully managed cloud service, runs on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, offering automated backups, monitoring, and security. Licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL), MongoDB is widely used for modern application development and is a member of the MACH Alliance, promoting modular, API-first, and cloud-native technologies.
