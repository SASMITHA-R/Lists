    <p><strong>HTML5 </strong>Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It represents the fifth major revision of the HTML standard and introduced significant enhancements over its predecessors, aiming to improve the language's support for multimedia, facilitate mobile development, and enhance interoperability across different browsers and platforms.

Originally developed as a joint effort between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), HTML5 became a W3C recommendation in October 2014. However, the W3C later retired its version in favor of the HTML Living Standard, which is continually updated and maintained by WHATWG.</p>
